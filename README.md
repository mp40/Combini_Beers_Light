# Combini_Beers_Light
## The App is light, not the beers
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis

A simple app built with React on the frontend and Firebase on the backend.
Delpoyed on Heroku.

It stores the following data:

* Two quality beers commonly found in convenience stores in Japan
* Price of a 500ml can
* Price of a 350ml can

## Install procedure
```yarn install```

## Is it deployed?
Yep, just head over to Heroku. <br/>

## How to use
### Click the 1000 yen button
Increments how much you are willing to spend on beer by 1000 yen.
There is no reset. This a feature, not a bug.
### Click the Asahi Super Dry button
Returns how many Asahi Super Dry beers you can get from the Combini.
### Click the Yebisu button
Returns how many Yebisu beers you can get from the Combini if you are feeling fancy.
